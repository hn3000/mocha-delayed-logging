# delayed console logging for mocha

If you're unit testing code that also prints some debug info or warnings
with `console.log`, `console.warn` or uses some other `console` output 
in node, then just add `require('@hn3000/mocha-delayed-logging')` and only
see console output for failed tests.


## Example output

Run `npm test` or `yarn test` in this project to see this example. (Sorry, 
couldn't automate the check for debug output in a failing test.)

```
$ npm test

> @hn3000/mocha-delayed-logging@1.0.0 test /Users/hn3000/play/mocha-delayed-logging
> mocha



  unit testing
    with logging
      âœ“ won't log visibly if successful
      1) will show all logging output for failed tests (and so this test must fail)
dummy log
dummy warning
dummy info
dummy error
there should be 4 lines, each starting with `dummy`, above


  1 passing (7ms)
  1 failing

  1) unit testing
       with logging
         will show all logging output for failed tests (and so this test must fail):
     AssertionError: not an actual failure, just a way to force the logging to be visible
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/test.js:16:7)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)



npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
